History of Internet
1950s-multitasking
1957 sharing using one system but with many users
1960-1980
packet switching// introduced by the national physical lab (NPL)
technique for transmitting long messages of data
messages is broken into a number of parts that are sent independently then formed once recieved . messages take different routes until it all pass on the same server.
packet loss//packets of data fail to reach the destination

ARPANET//

TCP/IP//

How internet works
Building blocks of internet
OSI Reference model: physical/data link/network/transpoort/sessiom/presntxn/app
TCP/IP: network interface/internet/transport/app

basic layers:
Network INterface// how devices communicate using a physical medium
modem //modulator converts signals from digital to analog
asscess point (router) for wireles devices

internet backbone -underwater (submarine cables)

Internet// std method for device-device comm is used (protocol)
Internet protocol (IP)
3 functions
1. Id of each device connecrted to network
2. formatting of msgs
3. routing of messages from source to destination
device ID-IP address is required
unique to all devices connected to network

127.0.0.1 -localhost
16 digits (hexadecimal) 0-9/A-F
newer version of IP address IPv6

Domain Name System (DNS) IP address to string of texts//naming sys that maps a domain name to a specific IP address
www (3rd level domain).example(2nd level domain).com(top level domain)// www.example.com
message format 

packet routing//packets travel across the globe taking the shortest route possible/indiv packets arrive and reassembled/once assembled message will be sent into orig computer as confirmation

App//activities and functions that can be performed using the internet
email
games
etc
